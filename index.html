                <p>
                    Students all over the country are entering college without getting the opportunity to have an in-person orientation, and are expected to be able to navigate
                    the campus on their own with no prior knowledge of the campus layout. New students need an easier way to be able to find out where their classes are, and how to get to them without
                    being late to class.

                <p>
                    As we created this Affinity Diagram, we came up with more ideas to 
                    have a lot more usage than just a map. We decided that this app
                    can have much more purpose for the school, instead of just a map.

                <p>
                    We decided to work together to create personas that were related to
                    our project. Each of these personas have the same problem; dealing with their
                    first year of college and trying to navigate it the most simplest way they can.

                <p>
                    Creating the personas allowed us to create scnearios and people who
                    has different reasons of using the App and it also shows ways this app can be used.
